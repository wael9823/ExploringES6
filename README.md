#Exploring ES6 Textbook Practice
Welcome everyone. I am learning ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) from the textbook Exploring ES6. This repository has some of the codes I practiced while learning from the book along with unit testing using Jest. Please do reach out to me if there is anything I can help with.

Thanks! Have a good day ahead. Wael
